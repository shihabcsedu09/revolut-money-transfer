### How the application handles transaction and concurrent transfer
1. ```@UnitOfWork``` annotation over jersey resource method make sure the transaction atomicity.
2. ```Optimistic Lock``` is implemented by adding a version attribute in the entity class. That ensures if other transaction updates the account entity in the middle of a transfer it will no commit the current one by checking the version number.
### Available APIs

***Account API***: 

**POST**:
Before transfering amount you need to first create a source acccount and a destination account with balance. This you can do by send a post request ```/account```  endpoint with the following as a request body.

```javascript
{
  "name" : "Some Test Account",
  "balance" : 100.22
}
```
| Parameter | Type | Description |

| `name` | `string` | **Required**. The name of the account |
| `balance` | `decimal` | **Required**. The initial balance of the amount, must be a positive decimal |

Corresponding cURL command: 
```
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8080/account/ \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "name" : "Some Test Account",
  "balance" : 100.22
}'
```

### Limitations
1. Load/Stress test of the application to see how it works with concurrent requests
2. Swagger integration for api documentation
3. Code Quality linters integration like sonar cloud.
4. More granular exception mapping.
